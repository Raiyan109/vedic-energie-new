                                        The food Industry is not just one of the largest industries but is very important too. As food is our daily requirement, but the Food Industry is causing hazards and harm to nature. The production of food articles involves the steps like growing, processing, packaging, storing, and transporting all these steps cause pollution to nature and contribute to greenhouse gases. Processes like cultivation results and the production of methane, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, and other gas which is caused by use of fertilizers, pesticides, and the cutting of forests. The very next step of the process is packaging which requires a lot of paper, aluminum, and other materials, the production of which is harmful to nature. The process does not end here, the transportation of food is also a threat to nature as it involves air pollution in the process of transportation.
